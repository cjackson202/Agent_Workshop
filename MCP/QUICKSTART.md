# Quick Start Guide - MCP Workshop

## 🚀 Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### 1️⃣ Setup Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies (2 min)

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Azure ML Notebooks

# Install dependencies
cd /path/to/ERM_Agents_Workshop/MCP
pip install -r requirements.txt --pre

# Authenticate with Azure (Managed Identity)
az login --identity
```

### 2️⃣ Start the MCP Server (30 seconds)

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
# Make sure venv is activated
source .venv/bin/activate
python server.py
```

✅ You should see: "Server is running... (Press CTRL+C to stop)"

### 3️⃣ Test the Server Locally (1 min)

**Terminal 2 (new terminal):**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python test_mcp.py
```

✅ You should see: List of tools and test results

### 4️⃣ Create Agent in Portal & Configure Script (2 min)

**Create agent in Azure AI Foundry Studio:**
1. Go to [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your project → Agents
3. Click "Create Agent"
4. Name: "Workshop_MCP_Agent"
5. Instructions: "You answer questions by using the available tools only."
6. Model: Select your gpt-4o-mini deployment
7. **Copy the Agent ID**

**Update [get_agent_mi.py](get_agent_mi.py):**
- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` → Your project URL
- `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` → Your model name
- `AGENT_ID` → The Agent ID you just copied

Find project URL in Azure AI Foundry Studio → Project Settings

### 5️⃣ Connect to Your Agent (2 min)

**Make sure Terminal 1 (server) is still running!**

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python get_agent_mi.py
```

Try these prompts:
- `What is 25 + 17?`
- `Calculate 100 minus 45`
- `What is the sum of 12, 8, and 5?`

## 📋 Workshop Checklist

Before the workshop, participants should:
- [ ] Have access to Azure ML Notebooks
- [ ] Have Python 3.10+ available in Azure ML
- [ ] Have Azure CLI available in notebook environment
- [ ] Authenticate with `az login --identity`
- [ ] Have access to an Azure AI Foundry project
- [ ] Have a GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini model deployed
- [ ] Clone this repository to Azure ML workspace
- [ ] Create virtual environment
- [ ] Test that they can run `python server.py` without errors

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Connection refused" error
**Solution:** Make sure `python server.py` is running in another terminal

### Problem: Azure authentication errors
**Solution:** Run `az login --identity` (for Azure ML Notebooks) and verify with `az account show`

### Problem: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt --pre`

### Problem: Port 8080 already in use
**Solution:** 
1. Find what's using port 8080: `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`
2. Stop that process or change the port in both server.py and the agent scripts

## 📚 Next Steps

Once you complete the quick start:
1. Read the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed workshop exercises
2. Add your own custom tools to [server.py](server.py)
3. Experiment with different agent instructions
4. Try the advanced exercises

## 👥 Instructor Notes

### Before the Workshop
1. Test all scripts on your machine
2. Have your Azure credentials ready
3. Prepare example custom tools to demonstrate
4. Set up a backup MCP server (in case of network issues)

### During the Workshop
1. Start with `server.py` code walkthrough (don't run yet)
2. Explain MCP concepts before running code
3. Have participants run server first, test second
4. Save agent IDs for each participant
5. Demonstrate live debugging of tool invocations

### Common Workshop Questions
- **Q: Why create the agent in the portal instead of via code?**
  - A: Portal-created agents are visible in the UI, easier to manage, and follow production patterns

- **Q: Can agents call multiple tools in sequence?**
  - A: Yes! The agent framework handles tool chaining automatically

- **Q: Do we need to restart the server after adding tools?**
  - A: Yes, the server loads tools at startup

- **Q: Can multiple agents share one MCP server?**
  - A: Yes! That's a key benefit of MCP architecture
